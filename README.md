In a company's web page, activity logs are filled by employees. 

However, extracting these activity logs daily is a real pain. 

When it is tried to get daily reports for a week, the website gives the total work hour into the week.

Thus, for each employee, each day is entered one by one and then the data is typed into an excel file.

The code stores employee names as a list and then loop over them.

Also, gets the dates and converts them into a usable by the website format.

Inputs the start date and the end date as the same date to get a daily work hour data.

Then increases dates by one day and so on.

For each employee, a list that contains the daily work hours created.

Eventually, these lists are merged into a data frame. Then extracted as a .xlsx file.
